The <strong><code>ready</code></strong> read-only property of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer"><code>ServiceWorkerContainer</code></a> interface provides a way of delaying code execution until a service worker is active. It returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"><code>Promise</code></a> that will never reject, and which waits indefinitely until the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration"><code>ServiceWorkerRegistration</code></a> associated with the current page has an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/active"><code>active</code></a> worker. Once that condition is met, it resolves with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration"><code>ServiceWorkerRegistration</code></a>.
