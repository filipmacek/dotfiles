The <strong><code>AuthenticatorAttestationResponse</code></strong> interface of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API">Web Authentication API</a> is returned by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create"><code>CredentialsContainer.create()</code></a> when a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential"><code>PublicKeyCredential</code></a> is passed, and provides a cryptographic root of trust for the new key pair that has been generated. This response should be sent to the relying party's server to complete the creation of the credential.
