The <strong><code>Cache</code></strong> interface provides a storage mechanism for <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request"><code>Request</code></a></code> / <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response"><code>Response</code></a></code> object pairs that are cached, for example as part of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker"><code>ServiceWorker</code></a> life cycle. Note that the <code>Cache</code> interface is exposed to windowed scopes as well as workers. You don't have to use it in conjunction with service workers, even though it is defined in the service worker spec.
